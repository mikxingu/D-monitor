# D-monitor
Monitor important directories and be notified on the changes that are made on them.

## Motivation
This application was made due to the necessity to monitor a storage server folder for changes. As users would often put files on it and I was responsible for moving those files to their correct location, and due to the day-to-day rush, I would often forget to do so.
As I got into proggraming and I was presented to Apache Camel, I got this idea to build an application to periodicaly check that specific folder and, if there were files on it, it'd send me an Email reminding me to do the work.
